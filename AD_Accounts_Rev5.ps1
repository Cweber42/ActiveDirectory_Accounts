# You will need to edit the variables for your environment
# You will need to go through the script and edit the areas marked for it to work correctly in your environment
# The report used in this script can be found on Cognos The location of the file is Student Management System > Demographics > Demographic Download Files,
# and name of the file is APSCN Student General Information File. Copy this to your Cognos folder and name it.
# You will need the Cognos powershell download script and report.

#Example Usernames#
#Default for the script is Firstname.Lastnamelast2ofgradyr

#Firstname + "."+ Lastname
#Charlie.Weber

#Firstname + "."+ Lastname +Gradyr
#Charlie.Weber2015
#or
#Firstname + "."+ Lastname +Gradyr.Substring(2) <-This is default setting
#Charlie.Weber15

#Firstname.substring(0,1) + "." + Lastname
#c.weber

#Firstname.substring(0,1) + "." + Lastname + Gradyr.Substring(2)
